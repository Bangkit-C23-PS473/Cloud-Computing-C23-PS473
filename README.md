# BackEnd API-C23-PS473

This repository is made for the backend development of this capstone project. 

After configuring your project on the cloud shell editor like this repository or cloning this repository, along with installing necessary javascript modules, open the cloud shell terminal and run the command below as we're using Google App Engine

```
gcloud init
```
```
gcloud app deploy
```

Once the app is deployed, you can test whether the application backend is deployed correctly or not by using postman or using curl commands from the same cloud shell terminal
